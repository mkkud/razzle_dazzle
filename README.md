Razzle_dazzle scam game simulator


[wikipedia] Razzle (or Razzle-Dazzle) is a scam sometimes presented as a gambling game on carnival midways and historically, in the casinos of Havana, Cuba. The player throws a number of marbles onto a grid of holes, and the numbers of those holes award points which it is suggested can be converted into prizes. In reality, it is almost impossible for a player to win enough points for the prize. According to gaming expert Darwin Ortiz, the Razzle is seldom, if ever, run honestly.

Looking at the board with winning numbers in Razzle Dazzle may leave an impression that the chances of winning are relatively high, which is not true. Because of eight marbles (in original carnival version) or dices (in this simplified version), the results ditribution has very high kurtosis, which means that extreme values from standard deviation (which kurtosis is 0) have much less chance of appearing. Player is fooled by overestimating his chances of success. Also, when playing the game in real life, the dealer usually misleads the player by counting his points wrongly in the beginning of the game, basically giving him an easy start which encourages the player to stay in the game longer.
